better approch
using the hash map to store number frequency if number has 0 frequency that means number is missing

optimal approch
int missingNumber(vector<int>&a, int N) {

    //Summation of first N numbers:
    int sum = (N * (N + 1)) / 2;

    //Summation of all array elements:
    int s2 = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; i++) {
        s2 += a[i];
    }

    int missingNum = sum - s2;
    return missingNum;
}

we can also use xor for doing the optimal approch;
